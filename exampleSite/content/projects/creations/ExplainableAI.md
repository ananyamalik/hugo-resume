I worked on a project that aimed to predict whether and why would a customer leave the telecom service. This was a multilabel classification problem for which I used SVM and XGBoost to predict the customer’s position and then interpreted the reason for leaving using LIME. I am currently working on a project where using CNN I am predicting the nature of the tumour on images of breast cancer tissues. This prediction is then to be explained using SHAP. The aim of this project is to increase understanding predictions on medical data, to add on to dependability of such models.
